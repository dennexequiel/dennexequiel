## >Hello There!_
Technology should simplify, not complicate. I build solutions that do exactly that.

In tech, steady progress outweighs perfection. That mindset shapes how I work: keep learning, adapt quickly, and always look for ways to improve.

I have worked as a Salesforce Admin/Developer, Full Stack Engineer, Systems Supervisor, Tech Lead, DevOps Engineer, Senior IT Specialist, and Solutions Architect. Each role has deepened my understanding of systems, strengthened my ability to work with teams, and sharpened my skill in solving the right problems.

My focus is simple: automate what can be automated, streamline what is clunky, and deliver solutions that solve real problems for users, teams, and the business. I have led teams, implemented system integrations, and launched platforms that cut complexity and delivered measurable results.

Always building and learning. Open to conversations, ideas, and collaboration. Let's connect.
